# simple3d
Simple 3d rendering written from scratch (absolutely no geometry/graphics libraries used) in go! This has support for quick rendering based off of phong shading, shading with shadows, and full raytracing! Also allows for bilinear filtered texture mapping and textured sphere generation. It has a webassembly target, and has a obj file parser also written from scratch. Some test images below!
